## Learning outcomes

From the specification:

> • Construct appropriate mathematical operations to manipulate 3D objects
>
> • Use an industry standard graphics programming API (ThreeJS)
>
> • Develop code to interact with JavaScript events (mouse clicks, key presses etc.)
>
> • Test and document a graphics interaction system

This project has also taught how **orbiting cameras** work, as we weren't allowed to use the provided OrbitCamera.js module from ThreeJS.
