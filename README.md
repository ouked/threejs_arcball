# ThreeJS Demo 📦
A simple ThreeJS project for my *Fundamental of Visual Computing* module at University of Bath. 
You can read the full report I wrote as part of this coursework [here](https://github.com/ouked/FoVC_Coursework/blob/master/fovc-5.pdf).

## Learning outcomes 📚



From the specification:

> • Construct appropriate mathematical operations to manipulate 3D objects
>
> • Use an industry standard graphics programming API (ThreeJS)
>
> • Develop code to interact with JavaScript events (mouse clicks, key presses etc.)
>
> • Test and document a graphics interaction system

This project has also taught how **orbiting cameras** work, as we weren't allowed to use the provided OrbitCamera.js module from ThreeJS.
